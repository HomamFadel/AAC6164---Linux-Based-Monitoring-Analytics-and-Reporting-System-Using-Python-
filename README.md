## 📄 File and Folder Descriptions

### monitorig_dir.py
This Python script implements the directory monitoring module.  
It continuously monitors a specified directory and detects file creation, deletion, and modification events.  
For each detected event, the script extracts Linux file system metadata such as file size, permissions, ownership, and timestamps, and records the information in a CSV log file.

---

### directory_logs.csv
This file stores the output logs generated by the directory monitoring script.  
Each entry represents a detected file system event and includes structured metadata to support analysis and reporting.

---

### watched_folder/
This directory represents the monitored directory.  
All file system activities such as creating, modifying, or deleting files within this folder are detected and logged by the monitoring script.  
It is used to safely simulate file system activity in a controlled Linux environment.
